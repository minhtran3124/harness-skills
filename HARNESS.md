# HARNESS.md — How this repo's workflow works

This repo is a **skills framework with a risk/trust harness on top**. This file explains, in
plain terms, what "the harness" is, where it came from, and how it changes the way work flows.

For the full skill inventory and handoff map see [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md). For the
research that produced this design see [`docs/harness-experimental/`](docs/harness-experimental/).

## 1. Two layers: the engine and the harness

| Layer | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **The engine** (skills) | Invocable `/skills` that *do* the work — brainstorm, research, plan, build, review, ship. Each has hard gates and a defined handoff. | `skills/`, `agents/` |
| **The harness** (risk/trust) | A thin control layer that decides, *before* the engine runs, **how much process** a change needs and **when to involve a human**. | `skills/feature-intake/`, `hooks/`, `rules/`, `specs/<slug>/SUMMARY.md` |

The engine answers *"how do I build this?"* The harness answers *"how careful should I be, and
who needs to approve?"*

## 2. Where the harness came from

The model is borrowed from [`hoangnb24/harness-experimental`](https://github.com/hoangnb24/harness-experimental).
We adopted its **risk/trust *spec*** — not its files or folder layout. That repo is "all docs,
no enforcement"; this repo already had executable skills + blocking hooks, so we grafted the
*idea* onto our *enforcement engine*. (Full rationale: `docs/harness-experimental/evaluation/`.)

## 3. The one principle everything turns on

> **Ceremony scales with risk. Human interruption scales with ambiguity.**

These are two independent dials:
- **Risk** decides how much *proof and process* (planning, reviews, evidence) a change carries.
- **Ambiguity / confidence** decides whether a *human* is asked — never to classify risk, only
  to confirm intent or authorize a dangerous boundary.

A high-risk-but-clear change runs autonomously through heavy proof. A tiny-but-unclear change
stops to ask. Risk ≠ interruption.

## 4. How a change flows

```
request → /feature-intake → Lane + Confidence → route → build → hooks corroborate → ship
```

1. **`/feature-intake` runs first.** It classifies the request with a 10-flag risk checklist +
   hard gates, and writes `Lane:` and `confidence:` to `specs/<slug>/SUMMARY.md`.
2. **The lane picks the path:**

   | Lane | Path | Plan? | Human gate |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | **tiny** | direct `Edit` | no | none (hooks are the safety net) |
   | **normal** | `/subagent-driven-development`, two-stage review per task | yes | only if low confidence / ambiguous |
   | **high-risk** | full chain: `/brainstorming → /xia2 → /writing-plans → build` | yes | only on ambiguity or a hard gate |

3. **Confidence decides escalation.** Low confidence (any lane), or a hard gate, → stop and ask
   (recorded in `specs/<slug>/ESCALATIONS.md`, deny-on-no-response).
4. **Hooks corroborate the claim.** At commit time the diff is checked against the declared lane —
   the agent can't classify a risky change as "tiny" and slip it through.

## 5. How the harness impacts the workflow

- **Less ceremony on small work.** Typo/copy/narrow edits skip planning entirely (tiny lane).
- **More proof on risky work.** Auth, migrations, schema, public contracts, high-blast files
  force `high-risk` — full plan + reviews + a recorded rollback.
- **The human is asked less, but at the right moments.** Approval is gated on *ambiguity*, not on
  every step. Clear work proceeds with a notice; unclear work blocks.
- **Claims must be backed by evidence.** "Done" needs a re-runnable `### Verify` artifact in
  `SUMMARY.md`; behaviors aren't `implemented` in `TEST_MATRIX.md` without proof.
- **Rules are enforced by code, not hope.** What can be mechanized is a hook (see `CLAUDE.md`
  Hooks table); convention is the residue, not the rule.

## 6. The "hard gates"

These categories always force `high-risk` and can only be lowered by a human narrowing scope:

`auth · authorization · data-loss/migration · audit/security · external provider · public
contract · weakening validation · high-blast file` (e.g. `settings.json`, any `hooks/*`, a core
skill engine).

A hard gate discovered *mid-task* escalates regardless of the original lane.
