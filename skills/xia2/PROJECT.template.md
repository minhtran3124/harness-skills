# xia2 — Project Configuration for `<PROJECT_NAME>`

> **This is a template.** Copy to `PROJECT.md` and fill in. Auto-fill via `/harness:bootstrap-xia2` (recommended), then human-review.
>
> Each section below is consumed by `xia2/SKILL.md`. Sections marked **REQUIRED** must be non-empty or the skill halts (strict mode).

---

## Project identity

- **Name:** `<project name>`
- **Stack:** `<language + runtime + framework + key infra>` *(e.g., Python 3.12 + FastAPI + Postgres + Redis)*
- **Repo root (relative to this file):** `<e.g., ../../../>`

---

## High-Blast-Radius Files **(REQUIRED)**

Touching any of these triggers **Deep** regardless of how small the change appears.

- `path/to/critical_file.ext` — short reason (why is touching this dangerous?)

> **Heuristic:** pick files where (a) many features depend on this, (b) breakage cascades to multiple users/flows, (c) change requires deep understanding of side effects.
>
> **Empty list is dangerous** — Deep override loses a key signal. Better to over-include initially; remove only if a file proves to be reliably-isolated.

---

## Dependency Manifests **(REQUIRED)**

- `path/to/runtime-manifest.ext` — runtime deps; **adding entries triggers Deep**
- `path/to/dev-manifest.ext` — dev/test deps; does **not** trigger Deep on its own *(optional)*

> **Common manifests:**
> - Python: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`
> - Node: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
> - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
> - Go: `go.mod`
> - Ruby: `Gemfile`
> - Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`

---

## Shared Runtime Contracts **(REQUIRED)**

Configuration objects, modules, or protocol shapes whose contract change affects many call sites.

- `ContractName` (in `module/path`) — short description of what it controls

> **Examples:** `AppConfig`, `Settings`, env schema, public API protocol shapes (SSE events, websocket messages, RPC types).

---

## Session/Transaction Primitives **(REQUIRED)**

Functions/methods that scope DB sessions or transactions. **Changing scoping rules triggers Deep.**

- `function_or_method_name` (in `module/path`) — short description
- **Project rule:** `<which primitive to use when, e.g., request-scoped vs background-isolated>`

---

## Auth Surfaces *(optional but recommended)*

Files implementing authentication flow. **Changes here trigger Deep.**

- `path/to/auth/file.ext`

> Leave empty if the project has no auth (rare). Otherwise list middleware, JWT handlers, session managers.

---

## Knowledge Bases *(optional)*

Files to read at Step 2b in addition to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.

- `path/to/architecture.md`
- `path/to/guidelines.md`
- `<docs-or-decisions-folder>/` — solved problems with metadata
  - **Index (if available):** `<path/to/INDEX.md>` — read first (O(1) lookup); leave blank if no index exists
  - **Critical patterns (if available):** `<path/to/critical-patterns.md>` — always read; leave blank if none
  - **Search keys (fallback):** `<key1>`, `<key2>` *(used by Step 2b grep search when no Index file is declared)*
  - **Stale marker:** `<field or flag that marks an entry as low-confidence / unverified>`

> Empty = skill only reads the universal trio. Add domain-specific docs to enrich Step 2.

---

## Recent Decisions Folder *(optional, controls Step 2.5)*

- **Path:** `<folder>` *(or `none` to skip Step 2.5)*
- **Schema:** `<how subfolders are organised, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD/>`
- **Lookback:** `<N days>` *(typical: 60)*

> If your project doesn't track in-progress decisions in a folder, set `Path: none` — skill will skip Step 2.5.

---

## Public API Contract Types **(REQUIRED)**

For Quick condition: changes to these break the contract → fail Quick.

- `<contract type 1>` *(e.g., REST router signatures)*
- `<contract type 2>` *(e.g., GraphQL types, gRPC proto, websocket message shapes)*

---

## Entry Point Patterns **(REQUIRED)**

For Quick condition: any change inside these is **NOT** Quick.

- `<directory or pattern 1>` *(e.g., `app/routers/`)*
- `<directory or pattern 2>` *(e.g., `app/middleware/`)*

> **Examples by ecosystem:**
> - HTTP handlers (FastAPI routers, Express routes, Rails controllers, Spring `@Controller`)
> - Middleware
> - Message consumers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS handlers)
> - Scheduled tasks (Celery, cron entry points)
> - Lifecycle hooks (startup, shutdown)

---

## Notes for maintainers *(optional)*

- *(Add project-specific gotchas here — e.g., "X contract evolves frequently, treat as Deep when adding fields")*
