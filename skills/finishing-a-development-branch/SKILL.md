# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Complete development work by verifying tests, then opening a pull request.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Push → Open PR → Report URL.

This skill **only creates a PR**. It never merges, never force-pushes, and never discards work — a human reviews and merges the PR.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to open a PR for this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

Invoke the **test-runner** sub-agent to run the test suite. Pass it the list of files changed on the current branch so it can target the minimal relevant test set.

#### 1a. Identify changed files

```bash
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD main)...HEAD -- '*.py'
```

Use these paths to determine which test files to run (e.g. changes to `app/repositories/user.py` → run `tests/repositories/test_user.py`).

#### 1b. Run tests

Launch the **test-runner** sub-agent with the targeted test files:

```bash
cd apps/api && python -m pytest <test_files> -x --tb=short -q
```

If no matching test files are found, fall back to the full suite:

```bash
cd apps/api && python -m pytest -x --tb=short -q
```

#### 1c. Report results

Present a structured summary:

```
Test Report
───────────────────────────────
Result:  ✅ N passed / ❌ N failed
Files:   tests/path/to/test_file.py, ...
Runner:  test-runner sub-agent
───────────────────────────────
```

#### 1d. Handle failures

- **All pass** → proceed to Step 2.
- **Failures** → report the tracebacks, attempt to fix the failing code, then re-invoke the test-runner to confirm the fix. Repeat up to **2 retries**. If tests still fail after retries, stop and ask the user how to proceed (fix manually, skip tests, or abort).

Do NOT skip this step. Never push code with failing tests.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null
```

If the base branch is not mentioned in chat, default to `main`. Only ask ("This branch split from `main` — is that correct?") if there is a concrete signal it split from something else.

### Step 3: Push and Open PR

1. **Mark the plan shipped** — run Step 4. This updates `specs/<slug>/PLAN.md` locally only (`specs/` is gitignored — nothing to stage or commit). If no plan matches, skip silently.
2. Push to remote: `git push -u github <current_branch>`.
3. Invoke the **create-pr** skill to generate `PR_TEMPLATE.md`.
4. Create the PR with `gh pr create` against `<base_branch>`, using the generated template content for the body.
5. Return the PR URL to the user. **Stop here** — do not merge.

If a PR already exists for this branch, push the new commits and report the existing PR URL instead of creating a duplicate.

### Step 4: Mark the plan shipped

Runs as the first action of Step 3, before the push.

> Why this step exists: `status:` in `specs/<slug>/PLAN.md` records the plan lifecycle (`proposed` → `active` at execution start → `shipped` here). This is the **`shipped`** transition — a **local-only** signal (since `specs/` is gitignored) that you/anyone resuming the worktree can read to know the feature reached a PR. The edit auto-re-renders `PLAN.html` via `render-plan-on-write.sh`. Leaving it stale is the root cause of status drift across `specs/`.

#### 4a. Resolve the plan for this branch

```bash
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
slug=${branch#*/}                       # strip feat/ | fix/ | chore/ prefix
ls specs/"$slug"/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || ls specs/*/PLAN.md
```

- Exact match → use `specs/<slug>/PLAN.md`.
- No exact match → pick the `specs/*/PLAN.md` whose frontmatter `slug:` or title best matches the branch. If ambiguous, ask the user which plan this branch implements.
- No plan at all → **skip Step 4** (don't block the push).

#### 4b. Set status + append log

In the resolved `PLAN.md`:

1. Set the frontmatter to `status: shipped`. Canonical values are **only** `proposed | active | paused | shipped` — never invent others (`complete`, `done`, `ready-for-execution` are invalid and get silently dropped by the renderer).
2. Append one entry to the `## Status Log` (or numbered `## N. Status Log`) section, using today's date:

   ```markdown
   - YYYY-MM-DD — shipped via `<branch>` (PR #NNN)
   ```

This edit stays local — `specs/` is gitignored, so the status update is not pushed and does not land in the PR. It only persists in whatever worktree/clone holds the plan.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action | Blocker? |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Run tests | Yes — must pass to proceed |
| 2 | Detect base branch | No — default to `main` |
| 3 | Push + open PR (no merge) | No |
| 4 | Mark plan `shipped` + log | No — skip if no plan matches |

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Push code with failing tests
- **Merge the PR** — this skill only opens it; a human merges
- Force-push (`--force`) without explicit user request
- Use `git add -A` or `git add .` (may include secrets or junk files)
- Discard or `git clean` work — this skill never deletes work
- Amend an existing commit — always create a new one

**Always:**
- Run tests before pushing
- Stage files by name, not by wildcard
- Show the PR URL after creation
- Default to `main` as base branch when not specified
- Set the matching plan's `status: shipped` locally, using only canonical status values (`specs/` is gitignored; this is a local record, not a commit)

## Integration

### Skills

- **create-pr** skill — creates a PR template and fills it with the current branch

### Sub Agents

- **test-runner** sub-agent — runs tests and reports results
