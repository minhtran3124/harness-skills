# Auto-Correction Scope

Classifies what Claude may self-fix during implementation vs what requires user confirmation. Reduces HITL while keeping trust.

Applies when executing a `specs/<slug>/PLAN.md` task. For ad-hoc single fixes, user judgment rules.

Related: `plan-format.md`, `guidelines.md`, `orchestration.md`, `skills/feature-intake/SKILL.md`.

## Lane-aware autonomy

The intake lane (`specs/<slug>/SUMMARY.md`, set by `/feature-intake`) decides how much
autonomy applies. Rules 1–4 below are constant; the lane decides whether a plan and a human
confirmation are required first:

| Lane | Autonomy | Plan | Human confirm |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tiny** | Full auto — direct patch | none | none (machine gates are the safety net: `ruff-on-edit`, `auto-test-on-change`, `commit-quality-gate`, `risk-corroboration`) |
| **normal** | Auto with proof gates (subagent two-stage review) | yes | only if confidence low / ambiguous |
| **high-risk** | Auto-plan, gated-execute | yes (full chain) | only on ambiguity or a hard gate (Rule 4) |

Rule 4 (STOP) still fires inside **every** lane — a hard gate discovered mid-task escalates
regardless of how the work was classified. Ceremony scales with risk; the human gate scales
with ambiguity, not risk.

**Record always-on; verify substitutes for the human gate.** Every lane writes `SUMMARY.md`
(the audit record, incl. `Rationale` / `Alternatives`). For autonomous work, a re-runnable
`### Verify` row + independent review — not extra planning docs — are what earn the skipped
human confirmation. Plan-ahead docs (`design` / `research-brief` / `PLAN`) scale by signal
(`rules/orchestration.md` → Artifact policy); `FULL_ARTIFACTS=1` forces the full set when
maximum traceability is wanted.

## Rule 1 — Auto-fix (no ask)

Obvious bugs discovered during implementation:

- Wrong SQLAlchemy query (missing join, incorrect filter, soft-delete not respected)
- Off-by-one, null-check miss, wrong comparison operator
- Logic contradicting the `<action>` spec
- Test failures caused by the implementation mistake (not test design)
- Missing `await` on async call; sync call in async context
- Typos in identifiers

## Rule 2 — Auto-add (no ask)

Missing functionality clearly required by project standards but not explicitly listed in `<action>`:

- Input validation at API boundary (Pydantic schema, guard clauses)
- Error handling for documented failure modes (DB errors, broker HTTP 4xx/5xx)
- Missing imports, type hints, Pydantic fields
- `AppException.BadRequest / .NotFound / .ServerError` where bare `HTTPException` was used
- Token logging via `AIUsageService.log_and_increment()` for AI paths (including `success=False` on failure)
- `logger.error(f"[COMPONENT] ...: {e}")` where exceptions swallowed silently

## Rule 3 — Auto-fix blocking

Issues preventing the task from completing:

- Missing dependency (add to `requirements.txt` / `requirements-test.txt`, note rationale in SUMMARY)
- Syntax error in Claude's own output
- Wrong import path
- Alembic revision ID collision (regenerate)
- Linting failures (`ruff`, `mypy`) on newly-written code

## Rule 4 — STOP + ask user

Changes requiring architectural judgment — NEVER auto-apply:

- Schema changes (add/remove/rename DB table or column) not in the `<action>` spec
- API contract changes (route path, method, request/response shape) not in spec
- Removing existing functionality, even if seemingly unused
- Introducing a new external service dependency (new broker, AI provider, webhook target)
- Security-sensitive auth/authz changes (permission checks, JWT handling, CORS)
- Session scope changes (`get_db` ↔ `sessionmanager.session()`)
- Changes to high-blast-radius files: `settings.json` (hook registration), any `hooks/*` script (auto-runs every session), or a core skill engine (e.g. `skills/visual-planner/render_plan.py`)
- Replacing a service/pattern (e.g. swapping cache impl, replacing `BaseRepository` usage)

## Reporting

Every Rule 1–3 auto-fix MUST appear in `specs/<slug>/SUMMARY.md` under `### Deviations`:

```markdown
### Deviations

- Rule 2 — Added `AppException.BadRequest` for invalid trade_type. `app/services/trade_log_service.py`. Commit `abc1234`.
- Rule 3 — Added `httpx>=0.27` to requirements.txt. Needed by new broker client. Commit `def5678`.
```

If a deviation keeps re-appearing across tasks, surface it as a PLAN.md gap — original spec was incomplete.

## Rollback (high-risk / Rule-4 actions)

Any high-risk-lane work or Rule-4 action that proceeds (after the human narrows scope, or in
a loosened category) MUST record the exact undo command(s) in `specs/<slug>/SUMMARY.md` under
`### Rollback` before the work is considered done. Reversibility is a precondition for
autonomy — an action you cannot cleanly undo is not eligible for the autonomous path.

```markdown
### Rollback

- Revert migration: `alembic downgrade -1`
- Revert code: `git revert <sha>`
```
