# Agents

Sub-agent role definitions dispatched by skills (and by the orchestrator) for autonomous,
returnable work. Each agent is a focused role; anything project-specific lives in — or is
pointed to from — `PROJECT.md`.

## Inventory

| Agent | Role | Model | Dispatched by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coding` | Implement/refactor/fix code, end-to-end | sonnet | `subagent-driven-development`, ad-hoc |
| `test-runner` | Run the minimal relevant tests and report/diagnose results | haiku | after implementation |

## Portability model (mirrors xia2)

Agent role files are **universal** — they contain no stack-specific names. `PROJECT.md` is a thin
**index**, not a copy: it *points* to the repo's existing convention docs (architecture /
guidelines) for layering, error/validation, and style, and holds only the few execution facts no
other doc reliably contains (test command, source→test mapping, failure hints). When a repo has
no such docs, its *Inline fallback* section carries the minimum. `PROJECT.template.md` is the
pristine template; `PROJECT.md` is the per-repo rendered copy (drafted by `/bootstrap-xia2`).

> **Why an index, not a copy:** restating a repo's architecture/guidelines here would create a
> second source of truth that drifts. Point to the real doc; inline only when none exists.

**To reuse these agents in another repo:**

1. Copy `agents/` into the new project.
2. Run `/bootstrap-xia2` (or edit by hand): point `PROJECT.md` at that repo's convention docs and
   fill the *Test execution* section. The agent role files do **not** change.
3. Adjust the inventory table above if you add/remove agents.

`PROJECT.md` here is a *separate*, agents-scoped file — it plays the same swap-per-repo role as
the xia2 `PROJECT.md`, but is not the same file or schema (that one drives risk classification;
this one drives implementation + test execution).

## Skill vs. agent — when to use which

This boundary decides whether a capability belongs in `skills/` or `agents/`:

- **Interactive / human-in-the-loop → skill (runs in the main thread).** Work that asks the
  user questions one at a time, presents options, and waits for approval between steps cannot
  run as a subagent: subagents execute autonomously and return a single summary — they have no
  channel for a live, multi-turn dialogue with the user.
- **Autonomous / returnable → agent (runs as a subagent).** Work with a clear input and a
  self-contained output (implement code, run tests, write a PR description) fits a fresh-context
  subagent that does the job and returns a summary.

**This is why there is no `brainstorming` agent.** Brainstorming is inherently interactive
(one question at a time, approval gates, "user reviews the spec"), so it lives only as the
`/brainstorming` **skill**. A brainstorming subagent would be a category error — and the old
one was also a stale, drift-prone fork of the skill. Invoke `/brainstorming` directly.
